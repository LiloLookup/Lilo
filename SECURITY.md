## Reporting a Vulnerability

Usually, you should DM **[Northernside#3251](discord://discordapp.com/users/434417514332815370)** on Discord or write a [mail](mailto:lilo@nordcloud.space).

Please refrain from causing damage on purpose & spreading PoCs or (general) information/disclosure about the potential bug/vulnerability.

We classify critical bugs & vulnerabilities under the following criterias:
- May cause harm and/or damage (e.g. XSS, CSRF, Injections, etc.)
- May expose sensitive data, or data not meant to be public in general (e.g. faulty API behaivour -> resulting in data being able to be captured/stolen/traced, etc.)
- May deny the service being provided (e.g. (D)DoS, overloading capacities, slowing things down, etc.)

If you're unsure about whether your found bug/vulnerability falls under these classifications, do not hesitate to contact us.
